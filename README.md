# Thingworx UI Catalogue

# Overview
In this project you will find most of the out of the box thingworx widgets + 2 extensions (Google Maps + OpenStreetMap) ready for use, so the user can see how a particular widget is working and how can be customized by navigating through the mashups.

The project is divided into 6 categories (Actions, Input, Charts, Data Display, Maps and Custom Dynamic Tree).
